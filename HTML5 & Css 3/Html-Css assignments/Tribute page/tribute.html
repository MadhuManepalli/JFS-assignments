      <h2>Early life and education</h2>
      <p class="p1">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre
           of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the 
          State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and
           imam of a local mosque,his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry
           that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
           Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.</p>
           <p class="p2">In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described
                as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn.
                He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
                After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
                 Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli,
                  then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.
                  He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.</p>
        <h2>career and scientist</h2>
        <p class="p3" >After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
             Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development
              Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming
              a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing 
              a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part
               of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
               In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was
                the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the
                 Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket
                  project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded
                   the programme to include more engineers.</p>
